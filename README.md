# Aperture Slider

Aperture Slider is a JavaScript object that can be used to create sliding multi-part forms.

Checkout the demo by going to demo/demo.html

You will probably want to make a call to your own rest service each time the user submits a section of the form so you can validate and store their input.

Aperture Slider depends on [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for DOM manipulation and depends on [jQuery-BBQ](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq) for browser back-button support.
